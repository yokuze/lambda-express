# Request class

## Properties

|  Property | Access Modifier | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [`_parentRequest`](./lambda-express.request._parentrequest.md) |  | `Request` |  |
|  [`_path`](./lambda-express.request._path.md) |  | `string` |  |
|  [`_url`](./lambda-express.request._url.md) |  | `string` |  |
|  [`app`](./lambda-express.request.app.md) |  | `Application` | The application that is running this request. |
|  [`baseUrl`](./lambda-express.request.baseurl.md) |  | `string` | The URL path on which a router instance was mounted.<p/>The `req.baseUrl` property is similar to the `mountpath` property of the app object, except `app.mountpath` returns the matched path pattern(s).<p/>For example:<p/>Even if you use a path pattern or a set of path patterns to load the router, the `baseUrl` property returns the matched string, not the pattern(s). In the following example, the greet router is loaded on two path patterns.<p/>When a request is made to `/greet/jp`<!-- -->, `req.baseUrl` is `/greet`<!-- -->. When a request is made to `/hello/jp`<!-- -->, `req.baseUrl` is `/hello`<!-- -->. |
|  [`body`](./lambda-express.request.body.md) |  | `unknown` | The body of the request. If the body is an empty value (e.g. `''`<!-- -->), `req.body` will be `null` to make body-exists checks (e.g. `if (req.body)`<!-- -->) simpler.<p/>Middleware can be plugged in to support body parsing, e.g. JSON and multi-part form bodies. |
|  [`context`](./lambda-express.request.context.md) |  | `HandlerContext` | Contains the `context` object passed to the Lambda function's handler. Rarely used by middleware or route handlers. |
|  [`cookies`](./lambda-express.request.cookies.md) |  | `StringUnknownMap` | Contains cookies sent by the request (key/value pairs). If the request contains no cookies, it defaults to `{}`<!-- -->.<p/>Cookie values are generally strings, but can also be JSON objects. See `Response.cookie` for more details. |
|  [`eventSourceType`](./lambda-express.request.eventsourcetype.md) |  | `('ALB' | 'APIGW')` | Flag for determining which type of event source caused this request (Application Load Balancer, `ALB`<!-- -->, or API Gateway, `APIGW`<!-- -->). See `Request.SOURCE_ALB` and `Request.SOURCE_APIGW`<!-- -->. |
|  [`hostname`](./lambda-express.request.hostname.md) |  | `string | undefined` | Contains the hostname derived from the `Host` HTTP header.<p/>When the `trust proxy` app setting is truthy, this property will instead have the value of the `X-Forwarded-Host` header field. This header can be set by the client or by the proxy. |
|  [`ip`](./lambda-express.request.ip.md) |  | `string | undefined` | When an IP address is supplied by the Lambda integration (e.g. API Gateway supplies `evt.requestContext.identity.sourceIp`<!-- -->), that value is used. Contains the remote IP address of the request.<p/>Otherwise, when the `trust proxy` setting on the application is truthy, the value of this property is derived from the left-most entry in the `X-Forwarded-For` header. This header can be set by the client or by the proxy. |
|  [`method`](./lambda-express.request.method.md) |  | `string` | The HTTP method used in this request (e.g. `GET`<!-- -->, `POST`<!-- -->, etc). Will always be all uppercase. |
|  [`originalUrl`](./lambda-express.request.originalurl.md) |  | `string` | This property is much like `req.url`<!-- -->; however, it always retains the original URL from the event that triggered the request, allowing you to rewrite `req.url` freely for internal routing purposes. For example, the "mounting" feature of `app.use()` will rewrite `req.url` to strip the mount point:<p/>`req.originalUrl` stays the same even when a route handler changes `req.url` for internal re-routing. See `req.url` for an example of internal re-routing. |
|  [`params`](./lambda-express.request.params.md) |  | `Readonly<StringMap>` | This property is an object containing properties mapped to the named route "parameters". For example, if you have the route `/user/:name`<!-- -->, then the "name" property is available as `req.params.name`<!-- -->. This object defaults to `{}`<!-- -->.<p/>When you use a regular expression for the route definition, capture groups are provided in the array using `req.params[n]`<!-- -->, where `n` is the nth capture group. This rule is applied to unnamed wild card matches with string routes such as `/file/*`<!-- -->:<p/>Middleware and route handlers are not able to change param values.<p/>NOTE: Lambda Express automatically decodes the values in `req.params` (using `decodeURIComponent`<!-- -->). |
|  [`path`](./lambda-express.request.path.md) |  | `string` | Contains the path part of the request URL.<p/>When referenced from middleware, the mount point is not included in `req.path`<!-- -->. See `req.originalUrl` for more details.<p/>When any middleware changes the value of `req.url` for internal re-routing, `req.path` is updated also. See `req.url` for an example of internal re-routing. |
|  [`protocol`](./lambda-express.request.protocol.md) |  | `string | undefined` | Contains the request protocol string: either `http` or (for TLS requests) `https` (always lowercase).<p/>When the `trust proxy` setting does not evaluate to false, this property will use the value of the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header field if present. This header can be set by the client or by the proxy.<p/>When the request comes from API Gateway, the protocol is `https` regardless of whether the proxy is set (the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is not consulted) because API Gateway only supports HTTPS. |
|  [`query`](./lambda-express.request.query.md) |  | `KeyValueStringObject` | This property is an object containing a property for each query string parameter in the route. If there is no query string, it is an empty object `{}`<!-- -->. |
|  [`requestContext`](./lambda-express.request.requestcontext.md) |  | `RequestEventRequestContext` | Events passed to Lambda handlers by API Gateway and Application Load Balancers contain a "request context", which is available in this property. |
|  [`secure`](./lambda-express.request.secure.md) |  | `boolean` | A Boolean property that is `true` if a TLS connection is established. Equivalent to `'https' == req.protocol`<!-- -->. |
|  [`url`](./lambda-express.request.url.md) |  | `string` | `req.url` is the same as `req.path` in most cases.<p/>However, route handlers and other middleware may change the value of `req.url` to redirect the request to other registered middleware. For example:<p/>In the example above, the `GET` request to `/admin/users/1337` is re-routed to the `/profile` handler in `router2`<!-- -->. Any other route handlers on `router1` that would have handled the `/users/1337` route are skiped. Also, notice that `req.url` keeps the value given to it by `router1`<!-- -->'s route handler, but `req.originalUrl` stays the same.<p/>If the route handler or middleware that changes `req.url` adds a query string to `req.url`<!-- -->, the query string is retained on the `req.url` property but the query string keys and values are \*not\* parsed and `req.params` is \*not\* updated. This follows Express' apparent behavior when handling internal re-routing with URLs that contain query strings. |
|  [`xhr`](./lambda-express.request.xhr.md) |  | `boolean` | A Boolean property that is `true` if the request's `X-Requested-With` header field is `XMLHttpRequest`<!-- -->, indicating that the request was issued by a client library such as jQuery. |

## Methods

|  Method | Access Modifier | Returns | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [`constructor(app, eventOrRequest, context, baseURL, params)`](./lambda-express.request.constructor.md) |  |  | Constructs a new instance of the [Request](./lambda-express.request.md) class |
|  [`get(headerName)`](./lambda-express.request.get.md) |  | `string | undefined` | Returns the specified HTTP request header field (case-insensitive match). The Referrer and Referer fields are interchangeable.<p/>If the request included multiple headers with the same name, this method will return to you the \_last\_ one sent in the request. This is what API Gateway does when accessing its `evt.headers` field. If you need \_all\_ of the values sent for a header with the same name, use `req.getMultiValueHeader(name)`<!-- -->. |
|  [`header(headerName)`](./lambda-express.request.header.md) |  | `string | undefined` | Alias for `req.get(headerName)`<!-- -->. |
|  [`headerAll(headerName)`](./lambda-express.request.headerall.md) |  | `string[] | undefined` | Uses the same logic as `req.get(name)`<!-- -->, but returns to you an array containing \_all\_ of the values sent for the header with `headerName`<!-- -->. If you only need one value, use `req.get(name)` instead. |
|  [`isALB()`](./lambda-express.request.isalb.md) |  | `boolean` |  |
|  [`isAPIGW()`](./lambda-express.request.isapigw.md) |  | `boolean` |  |
|  [`makeSubRequest(baseURL, params)`](./lambda-express.request.makesubrequest.md) |  | `Request` |  |
